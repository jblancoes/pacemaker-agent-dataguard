This repository contains resource agents (RAs) compliant with the Open Cluster Framework (OCF) specification.

These resource agents are used by Pacemaker cluster resource management implementations and by now will be tested only in Red Hat Enterprise Linux from release 7 to the latest available/supported by RedHat.

Is there more information? If it is not here, no there isn't.

Issues to the proyect are enabled and will be answered asap.
