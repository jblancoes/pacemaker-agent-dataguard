This repository contains a resource agent (RA) compliant with the Open Cluster Framework (OCF) specification.

This resource agent is used by Pacemaker cluster resource management implementations and now will be tested only in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later versions. The agent is now in an early development phase but a first release can be expected to be available soon.

By now, the estimated scope is limited to regular Dataguard. Active Dataguard installations may be included in the future if I have a system with that kind of Oracle licensing for development and testing.

Is there more information? If it is not here, no there isn't.

Issues to the project are enabled and will be answered asap.
